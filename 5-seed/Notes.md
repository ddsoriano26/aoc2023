# Part 1
- Array of dictionaries
	- Or class?
		- Seed
		- Soil
		- Fertilizer
		- Water
		- Light
		- Temperature
		- Humidity
		- Location
	- If that seed doesn't exist in the property, ignore/discard the info - we won't get the information anyway
- Function
	- Get the source property and destination property
	- Extract destination start, source start, and range
	- For each start, add to array of classes
- Filter through array to find the property
- Consider only the given seed numbers
- Important note: Any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number.
- Separate each by new line
- If seed not found, initialize its soil with the same number
	- Need to handle every other case like this
- So slow, too many numbers
	- Maybe we need a better handler/checker for if the seed number is included in the range

# Part 2
- This is still too slow even when we consider just the inputs
- Can I minimize the input even further?
- Minimum seed is not minimum location
- Maybe we can get just the range of seeds?
- Game plan
	- For every pair of seed edges, check if lowest location is there
	- Then, check location's seed, then the index of the seed in the seed array
	- If the index is odd, change left index to half; if index is even, change right index to half
	- Calculate lowest location again, and check if new lowest is lower than the current lowest
	- If yes, continue loop; if not, we have the lowest
