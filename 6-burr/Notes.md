- Get time and distance
- For each time and distance:
	- Iterate through 1 to time, calculate speed?
	- Remaining distance is race time minus time spent to hold the button times
- Formula: `total_distance = time_i + (total_time-time_i)**`
- Formula: `total_distance = time[i] * (total_time - time[i])`
	- Do not include `total_time` in iteration
